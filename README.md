# macOS Virtualization Kubelet - Run native macOS workloads on Kubernetes

`macOS-vz-kubelet` bridges the worlds of Kubernetes and native macOS workloads. It enables macOS hosts to act as Kubernetes nodes, allowing you to deploy and manage macOS Virtual Machines at scale. The project also supports running Docker containers alongside macOS VMs within the same Pod, providing flexibility for hybrid workloads.

See [examples](example) directory for pod manifests, such as a [macOS VM pod](example/pod.yml) and a [hybrid pod with macOS VM and Docker side-car container](example/pod-gitlab-sidecar.yml).

## Introduction

`macOS-vz-kubelet` integrates native macOS workloads into Kubernetes by leveraging Apple's [Virtualization framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization) and the [Virtual Kubelet](https://github.com/virtual-kubelet/virtual-kubelet) project. Unlike traditional solutions that rely on QEMU/KVM under Linux, which struggle to fully utilize Apple Silicon's performance, `macOS-vz-kubelet` enables macOS hosts to operate as Kubernetes nodes with near-native performance.

This project is designed to:

- Run macOS Virtual Machines as first-class citizens in a Kubernetes cluster.

- Support hybrid Pods that combine macOS VMs with side-car containers.

- Streamline VM image management with a custom OCI-compliant format.

- Provide Kubernetes integration for scheduling and resource management.

`macOS-vz-kubelet` is an ideal solution for teams looking to scale macOS workloads, such as CI/CD pipelines or testing environments, while maintaining compatibility with Kubernetes' extensive feature set. For a detailed list of supported and unsupported features, see the [Feature Overview](#feature-overview).

## How It Works

`macOS-vz-kubelet` transforms macOS hosts into Kubernetes nodes by utilizing Apple’s Virtualization framework and acting as a Virtual Kubelet provider. This allows Kubernetes to orchestrate native macOS workloads with near-native performance, alongside optional Docker-based containers for hybrid workloads.

### Key Components

1. **Virtualization Framework**

   Apple’s Virtualization framework provisions and manages macOS Virtual Machines (VMs) natively. This ensures optimal performance by directly leveraging Apple Silicon hardware.

1. **Custom OCI Format for VM Images**

   The project introduces a custom OCI-compliant image format to manage VM images efficiently. Images are created with Virtualization.framework compliant tools and distributed using our forked ORAS CLI ([oras-macos-vz](https://github.com/agoda-com/oras-macos-vz)) tailored for this project.

1. **Hybrid Runtime Pods**

   Each Pod’s first container is always a macOS VM.
Side-car containers, managed by the Docker runtime, can complement the VM for tasks like logging, monitoring, or artifact management.

1. **Networking**

   Networking is managed automatically by macOS-vz-kubelet, with support for both local NAT mode and bridged networking for more complex setups. See [Networking](#networking) section for more detailed explanation.

1. **Resource and Lifecycle Management**

   Resource requests (CPU, memory) are supported for macOS VMs.

   Pod lifecycle events like creation and deletion are fully supported, while updates require pod recreation.

### Workflow

1. A Kubernetes Pod manifest specifies the VM image in the custom OCI format.

1. The Virtual Kubelet retrieves the image from the OCI registry.

1. The Virtualization framework provisions the macOS VM. Optional side-car Docker containers are started alongside.

1. The Virtual Kubelet updates the Kubernetes control plane with the Pod’s status, IPs, and lifecycle events.

For detailed steps on setting up and running workloads, see the [Usage Guide](#usage-guide).

## Networking

Networking in `macOS-vz-kubelet` can operate in two modes, depending on workload requirements:

1. NAT Mode (Default)

   - VMs are assigned local IP addresses via NAT.

   - Suitable for most use cases where external IP access is unnecessary.

   - Interaction with the VM is managed through kubectl exec, which uses SSH under the hood to connect locally.

1. Bridged Networking

   - Enables remote IP access by connecting VMs to tagged VLANs via DHCP.

   - Custom MAC addresses are assigned to each VM interface to ensure IP tracking.

   - IPs are dynamically retrieved by the `macOS-vz-kubelet` using tools like tcpdump and reported back to Kubernetes.

For Bridged Networking VMNet and VM Networking capabilities are required. These 2 capabilities require Apple's approval. Follow [this Apple Forum thread](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/656411) on how to request it. After that just pass desired network interface name to `VZ_BRIDGE_INTERFACE` environment variable.

Afterwards, simply generate yourself Mac Development certificate, App ID with those capabilities, and provision profile. Input those in Makefile and enjoy.

## Imaging

As mentioned before, the project introduces a custom OCI-compliant image format to manage VM images efficiently. See [Setup Workflow](#setup-workflow) for detailed steps on creating and pushing VM images to the registry. You can also check [OCI manifest example](example/oci_manifest.json) of our format.

Below are some key points about the imaging process.

### Compression

We we are running compression during the image packaging into OCI. The reason for that is quite simple. On average, our current macOS images are way above ~55 Gigabytes with tools like Xcode and simulators pre-installed. While we don't have to update them often, we still prefer to downsize them as much as possible before being able to distribute them. Using our own OCI content store implementation with custom compression, we can maintain our images on average at the ~35-gigabyte mark in our company's registry.

### Copy-on-Write (COW)

Each host can run two Virtual Machines (Pods) simultaneously (this number is a limitation of Virtualization framework). To avoid conflicts and ensure scalability we use a [copy-on-write (COW)](https://github.com/apple/darwin-xnu/blob/main/bsd/sys/clonefile.h) mechanism to create overlays of the disk image for each Pod. VMs on the same host can share the base image while maintaining their independent state through overlay files.

### Digest validation

We maintain a calculated digest for local image files to guarantee the correctness and integrity of VM images. The process is as follows:

- When a VM image is first downloaded from the remote OCI registry, a digest is generated for the .img file.

- Each time a Pod starts, the calculated digest is compared to the recorded digest from the remote store.

- If the digest is missing or if the .img file is newer than the digest file, it indicates that the local cache is invalid, and the image is re-downloaded from the remote OCI registry.

## Usage Guide

To start using the project in your Kubernetes cluster, build and launch the project on your macOS host using the flags and environment variables described below. Don't forget to sign your binary with a necessary Virtualization.framework entitlements:

```shell
codesign --entitlements resources/vz.entitlements -s - <YOUR BINARY PATH>
```

If you need bridged networking however, vmnet entitlements are required (see `resources/release.entitlement`). Follow the steps in the [Networking](#networking) section on how to request them. After that you can edit Makefile with your configuration and use it to build and sign your custom binary.

See [Setup Workflow](#setup-workflow) on interacting with the project after it successfully connected to the cluster.

### Setup Workflow

1. **Create a macOS VM Image**

   Use tools compliant with Apple's Virtualization framework (e.g., [macosvm](https://github.com/s-u/macosvm)) to create a base macOS VM image.

1. **Package the Image**

   Package the VM image into the custom OCI format and push it to the registry using our fork of oras [oras-macos-vz](https://github.com/agoda-com/oras-macos-vz).

   ```shell
   oras-macos-vz push -h
   ```

1. **Prepare Kubernetes Pod Manifest**

   Write a Kubernetes Pod manifest that references the OCI image. See the [examples](example) folder for a sample manifest.

1. **Run the Pod**

   Virtual Kubelet will pick up your workload, download the image, and start the macOS VM. Status is reported back to Kubernetes as if it’s a regular container.

1. **Interact with the Pod**

   Use kubectl exec to interact with the macOS VM or other containers in the Pod.

### Local cache

The cache directory will be `~/Library/Caches/com.agoda.fleet.virtualization`. Cache includes OCI images and their digest files and pod mount volumes if you use empty_dir volumes.

## Example Workloads

Check the [examples](example) folder for:

- Sample Pod manifests.

- Example workloads, including hybrid Pods with macOS VMs and Docker side-cars.

## Roadmap

There are currently some features that we need to work on for our open-source release:

- Higher test coverage including open sourcing end to end testing approach.

- Have CI/CD pipeline for the open-source project to allow for a easier contribution.
